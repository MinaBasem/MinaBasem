Thanks for stopping by, I'll tell you a little bit about myself
- I'm an Engineering student at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (Expected to graduate in 2024)
- I've been working with Python since 2014, wrote dozens of fun little projects that i couldn't save for the future (bonkers ðŸ˜•)
- As a kid i was inspired by the endless possibilities that someone with access to a compiler could achieve
- Data engineering caught my interest in college years and i was inspired to pursue it as my field of choice
- I'm currently working my way through some Coursera courses to set some strong foundations for my skills
- The story goes on...
